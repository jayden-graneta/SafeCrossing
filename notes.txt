Notes and other things about this project:

project idea: High accident areas - heat map
site name: SafeCrossing??

Tech Stack I wish to implement:
    - frontend:
        * leaflet.js 
        * maybe react 
    - backend:
        * node.js?
        * next.js?
    - databases:
        * PostgreSQL with postGIS (for geo queries)

✔️Checklist:
    - Create functional heatmap to display data [COMPLETE] ✔️
    - Work on landing page and core features
        - Maybe user login? (Allow user to submit accidents)
    - Find dataset to use (perferably city of toronto) [COMPLETE] ✔️
        - note: found dataset in GeoJSON [Chat recommends to convert to TopoJSON(smaller/more efficient)]
    - Learn how to use PostgreSQL
    - Finalize Techstack

Usecases for PostgreSQL:
    - Fetch and filter incident data dynamically
    - Calculate heatmap weights
    - Power dashboards and stats
    - Enable geospatial queries with PostGIS (optional but powerful)


Current DataSet: Traffic Collision report fropm the Toronto Police Serivce last updated 01/22/25 [https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/TorontoPS::traffic-collisions-open-data-asr-t-tbl-001/about]
    - import it to leaflet.js
    - later on load into postGIS for backend filtering/special queries
